Loaded and cleaned the housing dataset.

Used two features (area and bedrooms) to predict the price.

Split the dataset into training and test sets.

Trained a Multiple Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.

Predicted house prices using the test data.

Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² Score.

Printed model coefficients and intercept to understand the influence of each feature.

Plotted a 3D graph showing:

Actual prices (blue dots)

Predicted prices (red dots)
